Seratonin Sprint
The game where you (a brain) have to go get some yummy seratonin or you may become sad. 
A scrolling background brings you through neurons and time as you collect the molecules of seratonin, 
but watch out! If you don't get enough seratonin during the course, you'll become sad! 
If you grab 20 seratonin coins by the end of the course you win!
